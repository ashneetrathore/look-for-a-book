Look For A Book is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books by title and view key details, such as cover image, synopsis, and author. The app was developed in a 12-hour time span as a submission for the ZotHacks beginner-friendly hackathon hosted at UCI.

**Tech Stack** | Python, Flask, JavaScript, Google Books API, HTML, CSS, Heroku

## :classical_building: ARCHITECTURE
The application backend is implemented in **Python** using the **Flask** framework. Flask defines URL routes (`/` for the home page and `/search` for queries) and handles user search requests. When a query is submitted, Flask receives it via the appropriate route, fetches book data from the **Google Books API**, and processes the relevant details (title, author, synopsis, cover image, rating on Google Books, page count, and publication date) into a structured format.

The frontend is built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and uses Flask with **Jinja2 templating** to render dynamic content. First, JavaScript handles the submission of the search query by capturing user input and redirecting the browser to the `/search` route. After Flask processes the data, it passes the structured results to Jinja2, which dynamically injects it into the HTML template. This **server-side rendering** ensures that the fully rendered page with the search results is delivered to the browser for immediate display, without requiring additional requests. The app was originally deployed on **Heroku** during the hackathon event, but it is no longer live - it can be run locally instead.

## :hammer: CONFIGURATION
**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashneetrathore/look-for-a-book.git
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
cd look-for-a-book
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## :rocket: EXECUTION
Launch a local Flask web server
```bash
cd app
python3 main.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser to use the book searcher.

## :wrench: TRY IT OUT
1. After opening the application in your browser, enter the title of a book into the search bar and click the search icon or press `Enter`.
2. Books matching the inputted title will be displayed. Multiple entries may appear for the same title due to different editions or volumes.
